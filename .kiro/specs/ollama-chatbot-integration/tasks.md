# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Create environment configuration system





  - Create a configuration utility that handles both local development and production deployment
  - Implement environment variable loading with fallbacks for Ollama URL, model name, and CORS settings
  - Add validation for required environment variables and provide helpful error messages
  - _Requirements: 3.3, 3.4, 3.5_

- [ ] 2. Enhance Ollama service with remote connection support








  - Modify the existing Ollama API calls to handle CORS properly for remote connections
  - Add connection health checking functionality to verify Ollama availability
  - Implement retry logic with exponential backoff for failed requests
  - Add timeout handling specific to remote connections (longer timeouts)
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 8.2, 8.5_

- [x] 3. Create connection status monitoring system





  - Build a connection monitor component that periodically checks Ollama availability
  - Add visual indicators in the chatbot UI to show connection status
  - Implement automatic reconnection when service becomes available again
  - Create user-friendly status messages for different connection states
  - _Requirements: 2.4, 8.1, 8.3_

- [x] 4. Implement robust error handling for remote scenarios





  - Update error handling to distinguish between local and remote connection issues
  - Add specific error messages for common remote access problems (CORS, timeout, service offline)
  - Implement graceful degradation when the remote service is unavailable
  - Create fallback responses for when Ollama is completely unreachable
  - _Requirements: 2.2, 2.4, 7.5, 8.3, 8.4_

- [x] 5. Add CORS configuration and proxy support









  - Configure the React app to handle CORS requests to external Ollama instances
  - Add optional CORS proxy support for cases where direct CORS isn't possible
  - Implement proper request headers for cross-origin requests
  - Add environment variable controls for CORS behavior
  - _Requirements: 7.4, 3.3_

- [x] 6. Create setup documentation and configuration guide





  - Write comprehensive setup instructions for exposing Ollama remotely
  - Document the four connection methods (direct IP, ngrok, Cloudflare Tunnel, custom domain)
  - Create security guidelines for safe remote access
  - Add troubleshooting guide for common connection issues
  - _Requirements: 7.1, 7.2, 7.3_

- [x] 7. Implement network reliability features





  - Add request timeout handling with appropriate user feedback
  - Implement automatic retry mechanisms for failed requests
  - Create connection quality indicators based on response times
  - Add request queuing for when connection is temporarily unavailable
  - _Requirements: 8.1, 8.2, 8.4, 8.5_

- [x] 8. Update chatbot UI for remote connection scenarios





  - Add connection status indicator to the chatbot header
  - Implement better loading states for slower remote connections
  - Create informative error messages specific to remote access issues
  - Add manual reconnect button for when automatic reconnection fails
  - _Requirements: 2.4, 7.5, 8.1, 8.3_

- [x] 9. Create deployment configuration for Vercel





  - Set up environment variables configuration for Vercel deployment
  - Create build scripts that handle different deployment environments
  - Add deployment documentation with step-by-step Vercel setup
  - Test deployment process and document any platform-specific requirements
  - _Requirements: 3.3, 3.4_

- [ ] 10. Implement comprehensive testing for remote scenarios
  - Create tests for different connection states (connected, disconnected, slow)
  - Add integration tests that simulate remote Ollama connections
  - Test CORS handling and error scenarios
  - Create manual testing checklist for deployment validation
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 7.4, 8.2_
