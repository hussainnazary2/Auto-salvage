# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will integrate Ollama, a local AI model runner, into the existing React chatbot component for the damaged car business app. The integration will allow the chatbot to provide intelligent responses using locally hosted AI models through Ollama's API, ensuring privacy and reducing dependency on external AI services.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a customer visiting the damaged car business website, I want to interact with an AI-powered chatbot that runs locally, so that I can get instant responses about car damage assessment, pricing, and services without my data being sent to external servers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user opens the chatbot THEN the system SHALL establish a connection to the local Ollama API
2. WHEN a user sends a message THEN the system SHALL send the message to Ollama and display the AI response
3. WHEN the Ollama service is unavailable THEN the system SHALL display a fallback message indicating the AI assistant is temporarily unavailable
4. WHEN a user asks about car damage assessment THEN the chatbot SHALL provide relevant information about the business services

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a business owner, I want the deployed website on Vercel to connect to my local PC's Ollama installation, so that customer conversations are processed on my hardware while maintaining privacy and control over the AI model.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the deployed application starts THEN the system SHALL attempt to connect to Ollama running on my PC's public IP or domain
2. WHEN my PC's Ollama is not accessible THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messaging and graceful degradation
3. WHEN the connection is established THEN the system SHALL verify that a suitable model is available on my PC
4. IF my PC is offline or unreachable THEN the system SHALL display a maintenance message to users
5. WHEN configuring the deployment THEN the system SHALL use environment variables to specify my PC's Ollama endpoint

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the Ollama integration to work seamlessly between local development and Vercel deployment, so that I can test locally but serve users from my PC remotely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN developing locally THEN the system SHALL connect to localhost:11434
2. WHEN deployed on Vercel THEN the system SHALL connect to my PC's public endpoint
3. WHEN configuring for deployment THEN the system SHALL use environment variables for the Ollama endpoint URL
4. WHEN my PC's IP changes THEN the system SHALL allow easy configuration updates through environment variables
5. WHEN testing the connection THEN the system SHALL provide clear feedback about connectivity status

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the chatbot interface to show when the AI is thinking, so that I understand the system is processing my request.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user sends a message THEN the system SHALL display a typing indicator while waiting for Ollama's response
2. WHEN Ollama is processing THEN the system SHALL show appropriate loading states
3. WHEN a response is received THEN the system SHALL remove loading indicators and display the message
4. WHEN a request takes longer than 30 seconds THEN the system SHALL display a timeout message

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a business owner, I want the chatbot to have context about my car damage business, so that it provides relevant and helpful responses to customers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the chatbot initializes THEN the system SHALL load a business-specific system prompt
2. WHEN a user asks about services THEN the chatbot SHALL provide information about car damage assessment, repair estimates, and business processes
3. WHEN a user asks about pricing THEN the chatbot SHALL guide them toward getting a proper assessment
4. WHEN a user asks unrelated questions THEN the chatbot SHALL politely redirect the conversation to car damage topics

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want my conversation history to be maintained during my session, so that the chatbot can reference previous messages for better context.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user sends multiple messages THEN the system SHALL maintain conversation history for the session
2. WHEN sending requests to Ollama THEN the system SHALL include relevant conversation context
3. WHEN the user refreshes the page THEN the conversation history SHALL be cleared for privacy
4. WHEN the conversation exceeds a certain length THEN the system SHALL manage context window limits appropriately
##
# Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a business owner, I want to expose my local Ollama safely to the internet, so that my deployed website can access it while maintaining security.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up remote access THEN the system SHALL provide guidance on exposing Ollama securely
2. WHEN Ollama is exposed to the internet THEN the system SHALL recommend using HTTPS and authentication
3. WHEN configuring network access THEN the system SHALL provide options for tunneling solutions (ngrok, Cloudflare Tunnel, etc.)
4. WHEN users access the deployed site THEN the system SHALL handle CORS issues between Vercel and my PC
5. WHEN my PC goes offline THEN users SHALL see a clear message that the service is temporarily unavailable

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user of the deployed website, I want the chatbot to work reliably even when connecting to a remote AI service, so that I get consistent responses regardless of network conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the remote connection is slow THEN the system SHALL show appropriate loading indicators
2. WHEN the connection times out THEN the system SHALL retry the request automatically
3. WHEN the remote service is unavailable THEN the system SHALL display a helpful error message
4. WHEN network conditions are poor THEN the system SHALL handle partial responses gracefully
5. WHEN reconnecting after an outage THEN the system SHALL resume normal operation automatically
